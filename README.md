# nmode_prod_cheb

Tensor [n-mode product](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/07070111x) with vectors of Chebyshev series.

Implemented functions to generate Chebyshev series and a simplified tensor n-mode product subroutine. Results have been tested against those obtained with the [TensorLy](https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly.git) library.

Implementations in C and Cython are also provided, though they are still work in progress.
